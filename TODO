TODO
====
  * how to schedule a function to be executed in N ns?
  * Add thresold to detect click and pan
  * implement a top bar to mark selected column
  * support multiline text widget
  * support for user-defined input handler
    (when input widget is activated, run xterm -e vim str > text)
  * add support for negative colpos (align to right)
  * receive fine-grained x,y in Point? for sketch or imaging stuff is important
  * support for clipboard (implemented in gi_ backend)
  * simple way to define callback for buttons instead of reimplementing widget (?)
  * full text editing widget (multiline, cursor support, text format, ...)
    - this must be done with an external input handler (use vim, dmenu, .. )
  * mouse bindings in config.h (which mouse bindings we need? wheel to scroll?)
    - add horitzonal scroll wheel support
  * add support to resize images (scaling)
  * only focus buttons and entries (input widgets)
    - will make the design inconsistent and the code more complex
  * allow to load images from memory instead of files
  * define default image path in config.h

Transitions
===========
  * transitions (to change from one window to another)
    - this can be done in a simple loop() calling swk_update and using colpos

Events
======
  * We need a way to enqueue events
  * add function to click button 1, 2, 3, ... // clicking from code..

Think about a decent absolute/relative
======================================
  * column split position (w->colpos)
  * scrolling box (..)
  * font size (font_inc, font_dec, font_set)

Design rules
============
  * useful
  * usable
  * transparent
  * either discoverable or well-documented
  * reliable
  * as simple as possible, and no simpler
  * customizable
